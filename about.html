                    <p>When was the last time you saw a "Genie in the Bottle" dispense a real-life miracle? Well, given these uncertain economic times, he's come out and morphed into the Bookstore Genie. Rising from a stack of once expensive textbooks, he's now younger, chubbier and some even say "cuter." You can judge that one for yourself.</p>

<p>The Bookstore Genie's new life mission is to save college students tons of money on textbooks. The Bookstore Genie recalls when he was a student at The Genie Academy, where textbooks would cost less than half of what they sell for at most college campuses today. He doesn't understand why the cost of a regular textbook has risen more than 12 times the rate of inflation. The Genie thinks overpriced books are unfair, and being that he's a Genie, he set out to do something about it.</p>

<p>Bookstore Genie is reinventing the formula and relationship students have with their textbooks... where students have become accustomed to having a love-hate relationship with their books, they now have a little more love and a lot less hate. Students can now <strong>RENT</strong> their books from Bookstore Genie for a fraction of what it would cost to rent or buy them from a <strong>Non-Genie Entity</strong> (NGE... basically everybody else). </p>

<p>Bookstore Genie was founded by Farhan Daredia, a bright and charismatic student at George Washington University. After winning second place in the GW Business Plan Competition, Farhan is now extending the reach of the Genie's magic throughout the country. Students at college campuses across the country are signing up as Genie Reps to spread the good word by inviting students to rent their books from Bookstore Genie. Thanks to the Genie, everyone is saving money -- and there is definitely some magic in that!</p>

<p>Believe it or not, the Bookstore Genie team does not operate inside a bottle. We work out of an office building just a few blocks away from our humble college beginnings. We balance hard work with fun, but are all driven by one basic belief: <strong>all students deserve a Genie they can trust!</strong></p>

                            <p>Disgusted by the textbook monopoly, the original Genie broke the bottle and Farhan sprang forth.  Bright, motivated and driven to change the world, the original Genie couldn't put our Chief Executive Genie back into the bottle.  Be forewarned: if you ever meet our Chief Executive, be prepared to be swept into his enterprise web through his magnetic abilities and genie-like qualities.</p>

He is gifted, driven, cherubic and able to work a week without sleep and never miss a line of code.   When not pounding the laptop, Eugenie is trolling deep Atlantic waters for big game fish.  He's a genie that prefers to be outdoors chasing fish.  Not all genies are perfect.  Eugenie brings a solid business and technical background to the Genie Team.  Bookstore Genie is his second successful startup company.  As our Chief Technology Genie, his talent lies in delivering software code that works – and delivers it quickly.</p>

In Urdu, one of the Genie's many languages, "Q" means "why?" and that's exactly what Inkyoo asks everyday.  "Why can't we just give these books away for free?" he asks.  Why should students have to pay to learn?  Well, he's working on making it happen with a massive directory of free books the Genie will be bringing to you very very soon!</p>

                            <p>Born to be wild with bottled youth, Michael brings a blend of talent and experience to our team.  While Michael's resume boasts many accomplishments from earning an MBA, teaching at Georgetown to launching eight successful companies, he is most exhilarated when changing a headsail in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in 15 foot seas while racing to Bermuda on a 60' sloop.  Michael's true talent lies in knowing the right blend of marketing and sales tactics for building and growing young companies with high potential.  In case you were wondering, instead of a riding a carpet to work, Michael rides a motorcycle. </p>
