                                <p>Bookstore Genie is always looking to add qualified college students to our field team in the form of Genie Reps&#174;.  All Genie Reps are paid generous commissions on each person they refer and who subsequently place rental orders with Bookstore Genie.com. Each Genie Rep is given a unique Genie Code&#174; for his/her referrals to ensure they are paid their commission fair and square. This unique code also allows each Genie Rep to offer free shipping to their referral customers, ensuring that our customers are given an added benefit of going through a Genie Rep instead of going it alone to place an order at BookstoreGenie.com. Ethics and honest dealings are a very important part of what we do here at Bookstore Genieâ€¦we never cut corners and our use of PayPal ensures proper and timely electronic payments to all our Genie Reps. We strive to keep our Genie Reps happy so that they stay on our team each and every semester. Strong performers will be appointed the role of a Master Genie&#174;, who serves as the primary Bookstore Genie point of contact for all Genie Reps at their respective campus. We keep our Genies happy so that they keep our valued customers happy. </p>
                                <p>E-mail tony@bookstoregenie.com with some basic contact information about yourself. We'll get back to you within 2 business days. Please make sure to include a working cell number and an email address that you do check daily. We'd hate to pass you up for a Genie Rep position only because we couldn't get a hold of you.</p>
