                var oTextbox = new AutoSuggestControl(document.getElementById("txt1"), new StateSuggestions());

        <p>This first example simply shows the &quot;type ahead&quot; functionality.
        Type ahead involves placing a single suggestion into the textbox as the user types.
        Only the part that the user didn't type is selected so that the user can
        continue to type and get appropriate suggestions.</p>
        <p>Type a state name into the textbox below. Make sure the state name begins
        with a capital letter. The best example is to type &quot;Missouri&quot; one
        letter at a time. You will get suggestions of &quot;Maine&quot;, &quot;Michigan&quot;,
        &quot;Mississippi&quot;, and then finally &quot;Missouri&quot;.</p>
        <p>Try it for yourself:</p>
        <p><input type="text" id="txt1" /></p>
