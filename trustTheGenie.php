                    <h3>Trust the Genie is more than a tagline, it’s the first Genie Commandment.</h3>
			<p>Central to the Genie Commandments is price transparency.  The <strong>Trust The Genie® Price Comparison Tool</strong> gives students the transparency that our competitors wouldn’t dare reveal.  It ensures that you’re paying the absolute lowest price for a book before you rent it!  We allow you to compare our price for any given textbook with that of our competitors…all so you can get the best deal on that textbook, even if you don’t end up renting from us.</p>
			
			<p>At Bookstore Genie, we are motivated by the many victories students experience when saving money through textbook rentals. As an organization started by and for students, we are familiar with the frustration of paying a lot for a textbook we may never use again. We are familiar with the frustration of buyback programs that give us pennies on the dollar.</p>
			
			<p>With textbook publishers and college bookstores providing students few options for savings, we believe in introducing meaningful choice -- choice that saves students money. With the continued rising cost of textbooks, we believe that renting is the best way to keep your money in your wallet.</p>
			
			<h3>The Genie Commandments include:</h3>
				<ul class="list-type-9">
					<li>Providing price transparency to ensure students get the lowest price.</li>
					<li>Investing in technologies that make renting and buying textbooks quick and easy.</li>
					<li>Being responsive to all inquiries, complaints or concerns.</li>
					<li>Treating all of our customers as individuals with respect.</li>
					<li>Listening to your ideas so that we can improve our services and benefits for students.</li>
					<li>Always believing there are more savings to be made for our customers.</li>
				</ul>
				
			
			<p>If ever you have a question, compliment or complaint, don’t ever hesitate to contact us directly - any time day or night.  After all, we are genies, we don’t sleep.</p>
 
			<p>We practice what we preach.  Trust the Genie.</p>
