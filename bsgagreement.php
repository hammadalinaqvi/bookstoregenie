							<h2 id='no_responsibility'><a href="#no_responsibility"> Obligation To Rent/Sell Mispriced Books</a></h2>
							
							<p>BookstoreGenie.com, Inc. ("BookstoreGenie") shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders for any lawful reason, including without limitation products/services listed at an erroneous price, rebate or refund, or containing any other incorrect terms, information or typographical errors, or orders involving potential fraud or account abuse as determined by BookstoreGenie in its sole discretion.   BookstoreGenie shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit/debit card charged. If your credit/debit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, BookstoreGenie will promptly issue a credit to your credit/debit card account in the amount of the charge.</p>
							<h2 id='purchasing_books'><a href="#purchasing_books">Purchasing Books</a></h2>
							<p>When you purchase a new or used book from BookstoreGenie, your credit/debit card will be charged for the purchase price of the book plus applicable tax and shipping. When you receive your book from BookstoreGenie, the book becomes your property.</p>
							<h2 id='prices_availability'><a href="#prices_availability">Pricing and Availability</a></h2>
							<p>BookstoreGenie offers a large number of products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products listed on the BookstoreGenie website (the “Site”) may be unavailable from time to time.  Since we have multiple supply sources and are constantly updating our inventory, our pricing may change upon checkout.  Because of this, prices and availability of products on the Site are subject to change without notice.  Please be sure to confirm the price stated at checkout – that is the price you will be charged.</p>
							<p>Products may rent quickly and therefore there may be a change in the product’s availability from the time the product has been placed in a “cart” but before an order has been submitted.  Similarly, you should understand that the pricing of products is dynamic and constantly changing based on many factors including product demand and availability, such that there may be instances where you are able to place a product in your “cart”, but upon submitting your order for processing, the pricing for such product may have changed.  You agree that you are solely responsible for ensuring that any applicable pricing listed with respect to products in your order is acceptable to you immediately prior to submission of an order for processing.  Upon submission of the order, you are solely responsible for all costs, charges and fees resulting therefrom.  Please see the section entitled <a href="#buybacks">Selling Your Textbooks</a> to see how these dynamic pricing terms may also affect any books you may wish to sell to BookstoreGenie.</p>
							<p>On rare occasions, you may receive notice that an item listed on your order receipt has become out of stock.  You agree that we may rescind our acceptance and we may cancel any product(s) in your order without penalty if we are unable to ship the product you ordered due to unavailability.</p>
							<h2 id='returning_books'><a href="#returning_books">Returning Books</a></h2>
							<p>
							Return your books by the last day of your rental period
							. (For more information on our return process visit the <a href="/how_to_return">How to Return</a> page.) All items that originally came with the book, such as, CDs, DVDs, access codes, inserts, workbooks, study guides, etc., must be returned with the book.
							</p>
							<p>
							BookstoreGenie is not responsible for any return shipment that does not follow our return procedures.  This includes: (1) shipments that do not use a BookstoreGenie shipping label; (2) shipments that do not include the BookstoreGenie packing slip; and (3) shipments not properly dropped off at a (U.S. only) valid carrier location. (You are not allowed to request pick up.  If you do, your account will be charged for the associated cost.)
							</p>
							<p>
							Please note that our website will be down occasionally for regular maintenance during off-peak hours. We try to keep downtime as short and infrequent as possible, but it is always best to print your return shipping label a couple days before you plan on sending back your books.  BookstoreGenie is not responsible for books that are returned late due to Site maintenance.
							</p>
							<h2 id='rental_period'><a href="#rental_period">Rental Period</a></h2>
							<p>
							Your rental begins on the date your book is delivered, based on your tracking number, and must be returned by the last day of your rental period. Otherwise, we assume you are extending your rental and/or intending to purchase the book.  You will be charged accordingly (see the <a href="#books_not_returned">Books Not Returned By Due Date/Automatic Extensions and Buyouts section</a>).
							</p>
							<h2 id='books_not_returned'><a href="#books_not_returned">Books Not Returned By Due Date/Automatic Extensions and Buyouts</a></h2>
							<p>
							If your book is not returned by the end of your initial rental period, and you have not otherwise extended your rental period, you will automatically be charged for a 7 day extension at the same daily rate of your rental.* If your book has not been returned by the end of this first automatic 7 day extension, you will automatically be charged for a second 7 day extension, and thereafter you will continue to be charged for recurring 7 day extensions after each due date passes.  These automatic 7 day extensions will continue until the book is returned, or the book becomes subject to buyout at the buyout price in one of the three ways listed below.
							</p>
							<p>
							The buyout price equals the list (new) price of the book as set by the publisher plus any applicable sales tax, minus what you’ve already paid to rent the book, including any paid rental extensions.
							</p>
							<p>
							A rental buyout occurs in one of three ways: (1) you may elect a buyout at any time by going to the Extensions/Buyouts section and selecting the buyout option; (2) a buyout will be deemed to have occurred if the amount you have paid (or owe) for a rental, including extensions, is greater than the book’s buyout price (in which case you will be charged the buyout price only); or (3) a buyout will be deemed to have occurred if the book has not been returned after two automatic 7-day extension periods and you fail to pay all applicable extension fees (i.e. your credit/debit card is declined), in which case you will be charged the buyout price. Once you pay the buyout price of a book, it becomes your property.
							</p>
							<p>
							If you have not returned the book by the due date and we are unable to charge your credit/debit card, it is your responsibility to pay the fee immediately.  You will be notified via email if your credit/debit card was declined and have 15 days to pay this fee before your account is turned over to a third-party collection agency.
							<em>
							All accounts sent to collections are subject to an additional $50.00 fee.
							</em>
							</p>
							<h2 id='purchasing_your_rental'><a href="#purchasing_your_rental">Purchasing Your Rental</a></h2>
							<p>
							You have the option of buying out your rental.  If you want to buy out your rental, you will be charged the list (new) price of the book set by the publisher plus any applicable sales tax, minus what you’ve already paid to rent the book, including any rental extensions (the “buyout price”).
							</p>
							<p>
							To buy a book you are renting, contact our support department.
							</p>
							<h2 id='title'><a href="#title">Title</a></h2>
							<p>During your rental period, all books remain the exclusive property of BookstoreGenie. Your acceptance of the book and paying rental fees entitles you only to limited use of BookstoreGenie’s property for a specified amount of time and subject to the terms and conditions of this Service Policy. At the end of the rental period, you have no further right to use/possess the book.</p>
							<h2 id='lost_books'><a href="#lost_books">Lost Books</a></h2>
							<p>During the rental period you are deemed to be solely responsible for the rented book, and you are responsible if it is damaged, lost or stolen (whether or not caused by you). If you do not return the book at the end of your rental period, your credit/debit card will be charged the corresponding buyout price (see the <a href="#books_not_returned">Books Not Returned By Due Date Section</a>).</p>
							<h2 id='damaged_books_received'><a href="#damaged_books_received">Damaged/Incorrect Items Received</a></h2>
							<p>
							BookstoreGenie
							<a href="/5-Star Guarantee">guarantees</a>
							that our books will arrive to you in good condition. If you receive a book that is damaged or incorrect, you must notify
							<a href="/contact_us">Customer Service</a>
							within
							21
							days of when it is ordered. Once you do, our BookstoreGenie guarantee gives you the option of choosing between getting a replacement book sent at no extra cost, or returning the book for a full refund. Books purchased through the BookstoreGenie Marketplace are sold strictly on an "as-is" basis and are not subject to return or refund.
							</p>
							<p>
							If you opt for a replacement, BookstoreGenie will email you a free shipping label to return the damaged or incorrect book. At the same time, the rental period of the original book will be set to 30 days. To avoid being charged for keeping the original book, send the damaged/incorrect book back with the provided shipping label no later than the book's due date.  If the book isn't returned by its due date, auto extension and auto buyout charges may be applied.
							</p>
							
							<h2 id='damaged_books_returned'><a href="#damaged_books_returned">Damaged Books Returned</a></h2>
							
							<p>
							(If you received a damaged book, please notify
							<a href="/contact_us">Customer Service</a>
							within 21 days of your order date. See the
							<a href="#damaged_books_received">Damaged Books Received</a>
							section above for more information.)
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Books are required to be kept in like-new condition. If a book is returned to us as damaged and rendered unusable, it will remain the property of BookstoreGenie and you may be charged an amount up to the buyout price for the book. You are responsible for damage caused during the rental period and if the rental is damaged in transit back to BookstoreGenie because of insufficient/improper packaging. For examples of like-new and damaged books and their corresponding damage fees, please refer to the descriptions below.
							</p>
							<p>
							You agree that BookstoreGenie’s evaluation of a book’s condition shall be final and binding.
							</p>

								<div class='column_row'>
									<div class='one_half'>
										<dl>
										<dt>Required Condition - No Damage Fee</dt>
										<dd>The book has a firm cover with no noticeable damage. All pages must be intact (no creases, tears, or stains present). There can be minimal writing or highlighting, but no damage to the binding.</dd>
										</dl>
										</div>
										<div class='one_half last'>
										<dl>
										<dt>Unacceptable Condition - Damage Fee Applies</dt>
										<dd>
										<h6>Minor Damage ($15)</h6>
										<p>There is light damage to the book's cover (markings on the inside or outside, or portions ripped off) or pages (medium to large creases, tears, stains, or liquid damage).</p>
										</dd>
										<dd>
										<h6>Major Damage (buyout price)</h6>
										<p>The cover is noticeably damaged or missing. Pages are stained, missing, illegible, or otherwise warped. There is heavy writing and/or highlighting throughout the book. Any other condition that renders the book unusable, including exposure to chemicals, perfumes, cleaning agents, or tobacco, smoke etc. that causes any noticeable odor, will also result in a major damage fee.</p>
										</dd>
										</dl>
									</div>
								</div>
							 
							<p>
							In the event you incur a major damage fee and are charged the buyout price for the book you have the option to have the damaged book shipped back to you at your expense.  You must contact Customer Service within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the day you are charged the major damage fee to arrange (and pay) for the damaged book to be shipped to you.  If you do not provide BookstoreGenie with shipping instructions and payment within this time, the damaged book will be considered permanently and irrevocably abandoned by you.  Accordingly you will automatically forfeit any and all right, title or interest in the book.  The abandoned book will then be recycled, donated or otherwise disposed of in a manner of BookstoreGenie’s choosing without further notice or obligation to you.
							</p>
							<h2 id='highlighting'><a href="#highlighting">Highlighting</a></h2>
							<p>Modest levels of writing and highlighting are allowed.  If a book is returned with a copious amount of writing or highlighting, a damage fee may be charged (see above section).</p>
							<h2 id='what_we_rent'><a href="#what_we_rent">What We Rent</a></h2>
							<p>We only rent books that can be reused; workbooks, study guides, laboratory manuals, periodicals, and other consumable materials are not rented.  Furthermore, we do not guarantee that access codes/keys/cards, CDs, DVDs, workbooks, or any other type of supplemental material will come with your books, purchased or rented. If a book you rent or buy from BookstoreGenie arrives with a supplement, you are allowed to use it at no extra cost. At the end of the rental, all supplemental material must be returned with the book rented.</p>
							<h2 id='intellectual_property'><a href="#intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a></h2>
							<p>All rented items are protected by applicable copyright and contain proprietary information and material that is owned by BookstoreGenie and/or its licensors, suppliers or agents. Books/materials should not be used in any way whatsoever except in compliance with the terms of this Service Policy without express written permission from BookstoreGenie.  No portion of any rented item may be reproduced in any form or by any means, except as expressly permitted hereunder.  You agree not to copy, scan, photocopy, modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, reproduce, or create derivative works based on the rented items, in any manner, or otherwise commercially exploit the rented items.  BookstoreGenie reserves the right to terminate your account and rental if we, in our sole and absolute discretion, believe that you are in violation of these terms. BookstoreGenie does not promote, foster or condone the copying of CDs,  written publications, or any other rented items nor does it condone any other infringing activities. The use of CDs and publications rented to you is solely for your personal and non-commercial use.  ANY OTHER USE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND INFRINGES ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS AND MAY SUBJECT YOU  TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES, INCLUDING POSSIBLE MONETARY DAMAGES, FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.</p>
							<p>BookstoreGenie trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the services provided hereunder are trademarks or registered trademarks of BookstoreGenie.  Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the rented materials may be the trademarks of their respective owners.  You are not granted any right or license with respect to any of the aforesaid trademarks, graphics, logos, etc.</p>
							<h2 id='payment_information'><a href="#payment_information">Payment/Collection Information</a></h2>
							<p>As a part of the credit or debit card verification process, some orders placed on BookstoreGenie may be subject to a $1 pre-authorization hold.  This pre-authorization is NOT a charge, but rather a temporary hold placed on the card to verify that it is valid. In most cases the $1 hold is released by the associated financial institution within 3 to 5 business days.  In some instances, especially with prepaid credit cards, the issuing bank may take longer or require the cardholder contact them directly to have the $1 hold released. In some cases, if you enter incomplete or erroneous credit/debit card information the intended transaction will be declined but a temporary hold may nonetheless be placed on your account by your card issuer for the amount of the attempted transaction(s).  This temporary authorization hold may persist for several business days even if you subsequently re-enter valid card information and the transaction is ultimately approved and your card charged.   BookstoreGenie cannot be responsible for overdraft or other penalties/fees you may incur as a result of (pre-) authorization holds due to incomplete or incorrect credit/debit card information.  Please double-check that your information is correct before submission.</p>
							<p>Should a credit/debit card charge be declined for any reason, then as a courtesy only and without waiving any rights or time, and using the information you provided in establishing your account, we will endeavor to contact you by email, text and/or phone (and you hereby consent to such contact).  Your credit/debit card and other billing information is held on file until all books in an order are closed (i.e. each book is returned, or bought-out and all fees paid).  BookstoreGenie reserves the right to attempt a re-charge of a declined credit/debit card periodically, at any time and for any number of attempts, to collect amounts outstanding on your account.  Additionally, if the primary credit/debit card on file with your account is declined, BookstoreGenie reserves the right to charge any of the other credit/debit cards you may have on file with your account.  BookstoreGenie is not responsible for overdraft or other penalties/fees a customer may incur for such charges (or attempted charges). In any collections action, the person listed under the Billing Information of an account is ultimately responsible for payment.  BookstoreGenie reserves the right to use a collection agency and any other means necessary to recover lost assets or any payments due. All accounts sent to collections are subject to an additional $25.00 fee.</p>
							<h2 id='processing_orders'><a href="#processing_orders">Processing Orders</a></h2>
							<p>All orders take 1-2 business days to process and ship out.  Orders placed Monday-Friday before 10 a.m. Eastern Time have the current and next business day to process and ship.  Orders placed after 10 a.m. Eastern Time will process and ship over the next two business days. Our published shipping timeframes are good faith estimates only based on our standard shipping methods.  Although we use our best efforts to meet our published timelines, we can’t guarantee what day/date you actually receive your order.</p>
							<p>Please note that there may be certain orders that we are unable to accept or otherwise process and therefore, must cancel. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse, modify, or cancel any order for any reason.  Some situations that may result in your order being canceled include without limitation, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, limitations on quantities available from our suppliers, issues identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department, or suspected violations by you of any of BookstoreGenie’s Service Policy, Privacy Policy or Terms of Use.</p>
							<p>We may also require additional verification or information before accepting or processing any order. While we will make every reasonable effort to contact you by phone or email if additional information is required, if we are unable to reach you via the contact information you provided, or you do not reply to us within the allotted time frame, we will cancel your order.  If your order is canceled after your credit/debit card has been charged, we will issue a credit to your card in the amount of the charge.  In no event will BookstoreGenie be liable for any order changed or canceled as a result of any of the foregoing.</p>
							<h2 id='store_credit'><a href="#store_credit">Store Credit</a></h2>
							<p>BookstoreGenie offers store credit to customers who sell us textbooks as part of our selling textbooks program and to customers who participate in certain other promotions. All store credit is redeemable only at www.BookstoreGenie.com.  Store credit is non-transferable and has no cash value.</p>
							<p>When issued for selling textbooks, store credit does not expire, but it may in other instances. To check if your store credit is subject to expiration, contact BookstoreGenie Customer Support.</p>
							<p>It is possible to use store credit in conjunction with a valid coupon code, but store credit cannot be redeemed for cash or transferred to another person or account.  If you have store credit, you will have the option to apply it to an order during checkout. When applied, store credit will go towards the order total, including shipping and tax.  Any unused balance will remain in your account in the form of store credit.  If an order paid with store credit is later returned for a refund, the refund amount will be issued in the same form of the payment received (store credit and/or credit/debit card refund, as applicable).  Standard refund policies apply.</p>
							<p>All orders placed, no matter the amount of store credit applied, require a valid credit card which may be charged in the event that books are not returned by their due date.  BookstoreGenie will have the right to close customer accounts and bill the credit card on account if a fraudulently obtained store credit is used.</p>
							<h2 id='books_not_received'><a href="#books_not_received">Books Not Received</a></h2>
							<p>
							If your book is not delivered to you in a timely manner or you receive a book you did not order, you must inform Bookstore Genie Customer Support within three (3) business days of your order's delivery estimate/date.  If you do not notify Customer Service within this time frame, we will be unable to send a timely replacement or make a claim with the distributor and or/carrier for a lost or incorrect order. Any shipment that you fail to report as undelivered or incorrect within three (3) business days of the estimated delivery date shall be conclusively deemed to have been correct and properly delivered. Accordingly, you will be fully liable for the order.
							</p>
							<h2 id='third_party_collection'><a href="#third_party_collection">Third Party Collection</a></h2>
							<p>
							BookstoreGenie reserves the right to provide third parties with information relevant to the collection of any amounts due for books not returned, extended without approval, or damaged beyond terms.  We will disclose your personal information without your consent to collect delinquent fees outstanding, protect or enforce our rights, protect or enforce the rights of a third party, or as may be required by law.
							</p>
							<h2 id='refunds'><a href="#refunds">Refunds</a></h2>
							<p>
							If you wish to return a rental for a refund, you must contact BookstoreGenie Customer Support within 14 days of your order date. You will be e-mailed a prepaid shipping label to return your book(s). You must make your return using this prepaid label at a UPS location.
							BookstoreGenie will not honor refunds on books shipped back late or refunds not using the BookstoreGenie prepaid shipping label. All books must be returned in the condition in which they were received. Failure to follow any of the above rules can result in your book being ineligible for a refund.
							</p>
							<p>You will be notified via email once your return has been received and processed, which can take 2-4 weeks. Once the return has been processed, a refund will be posted to the credit/debit card you used to place your order. It normally takes 5-10 business days for financial institutions to process this transaction.</p>
							<p>Refusing delivery is not an acceptable way to return a book, for a refund or at the end of the rental period. BookstoreGenie is not responsible for books that are "returned to sender." If a book's delivery is refused for any reason, BookstoreGenie will make every effort to refund the customer as soon as BookstoreGenie, or its agent, has received and successfully processed the refused shipment. There is, however, no guarantee when and if the refused shipment will be successfully processed. However, in situations where you refuse (or fail to accept) delivery instead of using the prescribed return process, we cannot assure when (and if) the return will be processed.</p>
							<p>Please see the below sections for the difference between refunds due to BookstoreGenie's error and all other refunds.</p>
							
							<h2 id='bsgerror'><a href="#">Due to BookstoreGenie's Error</a></h2>
							<p>
							If BookstoreGenie makes a mistake with your order (e.g. you receive books that do not match your order or books with major damage, as determined by BookstoreGenie), we will gladly provide a refund (including books, shipping and tax). BookstoreGenie does not guarantee that books come with inserts or supplements.  For this reason, it is not considered a BookstoreGenie error if a book does not come with an insert/supplement.
							</p>
							<p>
							Books are no longer eligible for a refund if it’s been more than
							21
							days since the order date; in addition, if the book is returned to us damaged or not in its original condition, a refund will not be issued.
							</p>
							<h2 id='bsgmod'><a href="#">Cancellations/Modifications</a></h2>
							<p>
							Because BookstoreGenie systems are engineered to process and ship orders as quickly as possible, the majority of orders cannot be canceled or modified (books cannot be added or deleted, and rental periods and shipping addresses and methods cannot be changed, etc.) once placed. If you no longer want the book, you can return it for a refund once you have received it. Please see the Refunds section above for more information.
							</p>
							<h2 id='buybacks'><a href="#buybacks">Selling Your Textbooks</a></h2>
							<p>BookstoreGenie, in its sole discretion, will determine whether a book is eligible for a price quote issued through our program allowing you to sell us your textbooks (the “Selling Your Textbooks” program). We will not honor price quotes made for books that we determine are in unacceptable condition or without their accompanying supplements, loose leaf, teachers’ or international editions, or that do not match the corresponding ISBN that was listed in the price quote provided. When we receive books that we deem to be ineligible for purchase for any reason, we will, and you hereby agree that we have the right to, recycle (or otherwise dispose of) them on your behalf.  BookstoreGenie reserves the right to revoke/revise any quote for any reason until such time as the book is actually received and accepted by BookstoreGenie. If BookstoreGenie determines that the book submitted for buyback is still the subject of an outstanding rental (and thus BookstoreGenie’s property) then the buyback quote will be rescinded.  Instead the book will be treated as a rental return on the account rented, and that account will be reconciled accordingly based on the return date.</p>
							<p>BookstoreGenie price quotes are valid for a maximum of three (3) days.  This means that books submitted under the Selling Your Textbook program must be shipped within three (3) days of the applicable price quote being made.  If we receive books that were shipped later than three (3) days, we will compensate the customer based on the then-current value, which may significantly differ from the price initially quoted.  Under no circumstances shall BookstoreGenie be responsible for (i) any lost or damaged books, or (ii) the cost of shipping books under the Selling Your Textbooks program other than through your use of  the prepaid shipping label that we provide at the time of issuing the textbook price quote.</p>
							<p>By participating in the Selling Your Books Program, you represent and warrant that you are the lawful owner of the book and the book is free and clear of any lien or encumbrance.  BookstoreGenie is committed to cooperating with law enforcement to the fullest extent necessary to prevent the use of its services for any unlawful purpose.</p>
							<h2 id='not_rented_from_BookstoreGenie'><a href="#not_rented_from_BookstoreGenie">Returning Books Not Rented From BookstoreGenie</a></h2>
							<p>BookstoreGenie is not responsible for any books (or other items) sent to us in error. BookstoreGenie will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any extra books received, but we cannot guarantee such items will ever be identified or recovered. If an extra item shipped to us in error is identified and available to be returned, you may request its return in writing.  You will be responsible for and agree to pay all fees associated with the recovery and return shipping of such items.  The risk of damage/loss/delay for books sent to us in error is at all times yours alone.  BookstoreGenie shall not be liable in any way for the care/custody of non-BookstoreGenie property, and you agree to hold BookstoreGenie harmless for any damage/loss/delay etc. incurred by you or any person related to or arising out of items shipping to BookstoreGenie in error.</p>
							<h2 id='changes'><a href="#changes">Changes</a></h2>
							<p>By placing an order with BookstoreGenie you consent to our Service Policy, which may be amended by us from time to time. If we amend this policy, we will post any changes to this page so that you are always aware of the current terms and conditions. Please refer to this page regularly and prior to making any transaction so you remain up to date with the most recent terms and conditions.  This Service Policy was last updated on July 29, 2011.</p>
							<h2 id='governing_law'><a href="#governing_law">Governing Law</a></h2>
							<p>You agree that any claim relating to BookstoreGenie shall be governed by the laws of the District of Columbia without regard to its conflict of law provisions and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction over you and such claims, and to venue of such claims, being in the District of Columbia Superior Court.</p>
